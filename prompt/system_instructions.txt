You are a Master Literary Analyst. Your task is to extract a comprehensive character graph from the uploaded text.

Instructions:

- Analyze the entire text: Ensure characters from the whole book text are included, from the very beginning to the very end.
- Deduplicate: If a character is referred to by different nicknames (e.g., "Кузнечик" and "Сфинкс"), merge them into a single node with one unique ID.
- Use the nickname when the person is older as a main nickname. Use the nicknames which were used when the person was younger as alternativeNicknames.
- Relationship Mapping: Create a link for every meaningful interaction. Generate at max 3 interaction links between the same 2 characters in the same directions, and 3 in the opposite direction.
- Include at least 1 interaction between each 2 characters if there was an interaction between them. 
- No Prose: Do not provide any introduction or conclusion. Return only the structured data.
- The book is in Russian. Provide nicknames, persona, group, and links types in Russian. Technical properties such as "id" should be transliterated from Russian to English, for example "Kurilshchik" from "Курильщик"
