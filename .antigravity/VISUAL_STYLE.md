# Visual Style Guide: The Gray House Graph
**Overall Goal:** Create an immersive, "Gothic-Atmospheric" interface that feels like an old, lived-in school.

## 1. Aesthetic Identity
- **Primary Style:** Follow the artistic medium shown in `@example-1.jpg`, `@example-2.jpg`, `@example-3.jpg`, `@example-4.jpg`, `@example-5.jpg`, `@example-6.jpg`, `@example-7.jpg`, `@example-8.jpg`. Use high-contrast "chiaroscuro" lighting.
- **Texture:** Every UI element (panels, node backgrounds) should have a "weathered" or "parchment" texture as seen in your provided screenshots.
- **Palette:** Use the color scheme from `@example-8.png`: Deep slate grays, sepia, and muted ambers. Highlight colors (like red for 'The Rats') should be desaturated.

## 2. Avatar Generation Instructions (Nano Banana)
When generating character avatars (Slepoi, Sphinx, etc.):
- **Technique:** Use "Style Transfer" to apply the sketchy, charcoal look from `@example-1.jpg` to the character descriptions in `relationships.json`.
- **Composition:** Portrait close-ups with shallow depth of field. Characters should have slightly exaggerated, haunting features consistent with the book's vibe.
- **Consistency:** Ensure all the characters share the same "hand-drawn" lighting and stroke-weight.
- All the characters are teenagers.

## 3. Web UI Elements
- **Graph Nodes:** Instead of flat circles, nodes should look like old, pinned-up polaroids or charcoal sketches.
- **Typography:** Serif fonts for body text (e.g., 'Crimson Pro' or 'Old Standard TT') to match the "literary" feel.
- **Interactions:** Use smooth, slow transitions for the side panel (Framer Motion) to mimic the slow, heavy atmosphere of the House.
